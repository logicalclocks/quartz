The current repo is the implementation of the library of the design system of Logical Clocks, so called Quartz.

- NPM package of React components TS
- use storybook as documentation
- use Rebass as a base CSS frame and Emotion for overwriting style

The DS is first experimented on Figma before being implemented:

## Github Pages

An online version of the Storybook can be found here: [Quartz Storybook](https://logicalclocks.github.io/quartz).

The version deployed corresponds to the `dev` branch and is updated on every new commit.

## How to use the package?

### Installation

NPM

```bash
npm install --save @logicalclocks/quartz
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add @logicalclocks/quartz
```

### Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { ThemeProvider, Button } from '@logicalclocks/quartz';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button>My button</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

Since components are built on `rebass`, those have extended props from `Box` or `Flex' components.
It means that you can add some extra styles if they needed.

For example:

```tsx
<Button p="30px 40px 10px 0px" m="10px" width="auto">
  Button
</Button>
```

Put ThemeProvider Context on the top of components tree to provide the default theme.

The library has peer dependencies which need to be installed in a main project:

```json
{
  "react": "^16.13.1",
  "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
}
```
